# Missing-Item-Andriod-App
We are implementing this project for the B.M.S College of Engineering,
Bangalore. Because of this app students, faculty, and college staff will find their
stuff very easily. The app will automatically capture your email, which is given
when you register. To get a view of the lost item posted, one must report their lost
item, if the is data matching, then only that lost item is viewed. This feature is
used to avoid invalid claims.
